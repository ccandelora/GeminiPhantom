INFO:app:Processed answer: **The Wheel of Fortune** spins, casting its enigmatic influence upon thy destiny. Karma's threads entwine, shaping a tapestry where past actions resonate in present occurrences. The future is a realm of infinite possibilities, veiled by the mists of uncertainty.

The **Star** shimmers in the celestial expanse, offering hope amidst the darkness. Its radiant light guides thee toward a path of fulfillment, where dreams take flight and inspiration flows freely. Embrace the blessings bestowed upon thee, as they shall illuminate thy way.

However, the **Tower** looms on the horizon, a symbol of unexpected upheaval and transformation. Its presence suggests that seismic shifts are on the cusp of unfolding, bringing forth both trials and opportunities. Be prepared to shed outdated beliefs and embrace new paradigms.

The **Magician** stands poised with arcane prowess, symbolizing thy latent abilities and untapped potential. This card calls upon thee to manifest thy desires through focused intention and unwavering belief. The universe stands ready to assist, but it is thy own actions that shall shape the outcome.

Remember, the cards speak not of absolute destinies, but of potentialities that may unfold based upon thy choices. Embrace the wisdom they convey, and forge thy path with intention, mindful of the karmic echoes that may reverberate from past deeds.
